# 03.command-line-argument

Jest 支持命令行启动测试。

> 一般情况下，我们还是推荐 [使用文件的方式来配置参数](./04.configuring-jest) ，这样会更容易维护一下。不过命令行参数的优先级会更高，也有一定的适用场景。

你可以通过 [--help](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--help) 命令来查看，例如执行：

```bash
$ npx jest --help
```

  --version, -v                 Print the version and exit                [布尔]
  --all                         The opposite of `onlyChanged`. If `onlyChanged`
                                is set by default, running jest with `--all`
                                will force Jest to run all tests instead of
                                running only tests related to changed files.
                                                                          [布尔]
  --automock                    Automock all files by default.            [布尔]
  --bail, -b                    Exit the test suite immediately after `n` number
                                of failing tests.                         [布尔]
  --browser                     Respect the "browser" field in package.json when
                                resolving modules. Some packages export
                                different versions based on whether they are
                                operating in node.js or a browser.        [布尔]
  --cache                       Whether to use the transform cache. Disable the

  --cacheDirectory              The directory where Jest should store its cached
                                dependency information.                 [字符串]
  --changedFilesWithAncestor    Runs tests related to the current changes and
                                the changes made in the last commit. Behaves
                                similarly to `--onlyChanged`.             [布尔]
  --changedSince                Runs tests related to the changes since the
                                provided branch. If the current branch has
                                diverged from the given branch, then only
                                changes made locally will be tested. Behaves
                                similarly to `--onlyChanged`.           [字符串]
  --ci                          Whether to run Jest in continuous integration

                                popular CI environments. It will prevent
                                snapshots from being written unless explicitly
                                requested.                [布尔] [默认值: false]
  --clearCache                  Clears the configured Jest cache directory and
                                then exits. Default directory can be found by
                                calling jest --showConfig                 [布尔]
  --clearMocks                  Automatically clear mock calls and instances
                                between every test. Equivalent to calling
                                jest.clearAllMocks() between each test.   [布尔]

  --color                       Forces test results output color highlighting
                                (even if stdout is not a TTY). Set to false if
                                you would like to have no colors.         [布尔]
  --colors                      Alias for `--color`.                      [布尔]
  --config, -c                  The path to a jest config file specifying how to
                                find and execute tests. If no rootDir is set in
                                the config, the directory containing the config
                                file is assumed to be the rootDir for the
                                project.This can also be a JSON encoded value
                                which Jest will use as configuration.   [字符串]
  --coverage                    Indicates that test coverage information should

                                the test. If the file pathmatches any of the
                                patterns, coverage information will be skipped.
                                                                          [数组]

  --debug                       Print debugging info about your jest config.
                                                                          [布尔]
  --detectLeaks                 **EXPERIMENTAL**: Detect memory leaks in tests.
                                After executing a test, it will try to garbage
                                collect the global object used, and fail if it
                                was leaked                [布尔] [默认值: false]
  --detectOpenHandles           Print out remaining open handles preventing Jest
                                from exiting at the end of a test run. Implies
                                `runInBand`.              [布尔] [默认值: false]

                                This method receives a list of tests which can
                                be manipulated to exclude tests from running.
                                Especially useful when used in conjunction with
                                a testing infrastructure to filter known broken
                                tests.                                  [字符串]
  --findRelatedTests            Find related tests for a list of source files

                                completed running. This is useful when resources
                                set up by test code cannot be adequately cleaned
                                up.                                       [布尔]
  --globalSetup                 The path to a module that runs before All Tests.

  --listTests                   Lists all tests Jest will run given the
                                arguments and exits. Most useful in a CI system
                                together with `--findRelatedTests` to determine
                                the tests Jest will run based on specific files
                                                          [布尔] [默认值: false]

## 1. 安装

```bash
$ npm install
```

## 2. 示例说明

在示例中，我们选择了 [jest-html-reporters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-html-reporters) 来做报告模板输出，并制定了要手机覆盖率信息：

```bash
$ npx jest --reporters=default --reporters=jest-html-reporters --collectCoverage
```

运行之后结果：

```

我们也可以增加 `script` 命令（推荐做法）：

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --reporters=default --reporters=jest-html-reporters --collectCoverage"
  }
}
```

这样，我们可以简化测试命令为：

```bash
$ npm test
```
